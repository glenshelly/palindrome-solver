# palindrome-solver

##Description

This class provides static methods to satisfy the requirements of the following exercise:
```
  "Five Dwarves (Gimli Fili Ilif Ilmig and Mark) met at the Prancing Pony and
  played a word game to determine which combinations of their names resulted in
  a palindrome. Write a program in that prints out all of those combinations"
```

##Running the program

The ant build file (build.xml) can be used to build and run this project, using the following ant targets: 
```
    > ant compile
    > ant jar
    > ant run
```
The "full" ant target will do it all, and is also the default, so: 
```
    > ant full 
```
or simply: 
```
    > ant
```
